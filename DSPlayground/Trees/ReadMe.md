# Binary Tree in C#

## Overview
This project implements a **Binary Tree** data structure in C#. A binary tree is a hierarchical structure in which each node has at most two children: a left child and a right child. It is widely used in various applications such as searching, sorting, and hierarchical data storage.

## Features
- **Node Structure**: Each node stores data, and references to left and right child nodes.
- **Tree Traversals**:
  - Pre-order (Root -> Left -> Right)
  - In-order (Left -> Root -> Right)
  - Post-order (Left -> Right -> Root)
- **Insertion**: Add elements to the binary tree.
- **Search**: Search for elements in the binary tree.
- **Height Calculation**: Determine the height of the tree.
- **DFS Traversals**: Depth-First Search implementations.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of C# programming
